        	<h1>Glass Recycling</h1>
            <p>Over the past 50 years U.S. consumers and municipalities have made efforts to decrease landfill waste through recycling. The rate of recycling has risen tenfold and currently over 75% of consumers diligently separate recyclable goods from their trash (EPA, 2009). Some of these post-consumer materials, such as paper and aluminum, can be efficiently and effectively recycled into new products, but this is not the case for glass. In 2008, 12.2 billion tons of post-consumer glass entered the municipal solid waste stream, with just over 2.8 billion tons being sent to recycling centers across the United States (EPA, 2009). A disturbing fact is that only 23% of the glass sent to recycling facilities was actually recycled, resulting in a total of 11.6 billion tons being shipped off to landfills across the U.S. (EPA, 2009). The problem is that current recycling methods for glass are extremely inefficient.
            <br /><br />Nearly 90% of recovered glass is used to reduce energy and material costs associated with container manufacturing, where it is combined with traditional raw materials (EPA, 2009). When used in container production, the recovered glass must be free of contaminants such as paper, metal, and ceramics. As consumers, we often forget that the majority of the glass we use is brown or green; even colored glass is considered a contaminant, so the recovered glass collected through recycling programs must be meticulously sorted and cleaned. Once this is done, the remaining glass is ultimately thrown away. The energy expended on these sorting and cleaning processes is barely offset by the energy saved through diluting the raw material stream; in fact, if the raw materials are diluted by 10%, the overall consumption is reduced by a scant 2%.
            <br /><br />With the current demand to address environmental issues, many efforts have been made to increase the recycle fraction of glass. Researchers are continuously striving to modify manufacturing processes and improve the efficiency of sorting in order to accommodate variations and contaminants, while maintaining the quality and characteristics required in container production. These efforts have been largely unsuccessful and manufacturers have found that as the percentage of post-consumer glass increases, the quality of the glass containers goes down. EnVitrum™ has made groundbreaking progress that can utilize 100% post-consumer glass and will revitalize the glass recycling industry. </p>

            <h1>Current Problem</h1>
            <p>Current materials technology cannot meet the expanding needs of the green building market. To address environmental concerns, forward-thinking architects and urban planners are envisioning buildings that utilize sustainable materials and integrate energy production, wastewater management and plant cultivation. This will require competitively priced green materials that perform as well as standard products.
            <br /><br />EnVitrum™ can meet these needs with the innovative VitroBrick™ that is 25% cheaper and up to 10% stronger than masonry. Our proprietary manufacturing process uses 100% post-consumer glass and requires 60% less production energy than masonry. The use of waste stream materials, coupled with EnVitrum’s™ cutting-edge platform technology, translates to minimized production costs and reduced time-to-market. EnVitrum’s™ technology provides a powerful marketing edge in today’s consumer landscape.</p>
