        	<h1>This is what we're doing.</h1>
        	<p>The EnVitrum™ team quickly realized that the problems of post-consumer glass recycling would not be overcome by eradicating “defects,” but rather by managing and exploiting them. The recycled glass market has been limited by our conceptions regarding the characteristics of glass and the methods by which glass is manufactured. We have come to think of glass as a solid, transparent material that must be heated to melting or near melting temperatures before it is workable.
            <br /><br />Once these restrictions were reevaluated, a wide variety of products and processes could be explored. Our result was a novel manufacturing process that utilizes crushed, 100% post-consumer glass, regardless of color and contaminants. Using EnVitrum’s™ process, the glass can be cold-worked at temperatures far below the melting point, resulting in energy savings of up to 75% over conventional, hot-working techniques. By eliminating the need for extensive sorting and cleaning, we are further reducing equipment requirements, energy consumption and operating costs associated with glass recycling. Moreover, EnVitrum’s™ products are compatible with closed-loop manufacturing, where materials can be reprocessed indefinitely.
            <br /><br />EnVitrum™ is utilizing the enormous waste stream of post-consumer glass to provide sustainable product solutions to the sub-par recycled glass industry. By examining the problems faced in glass recycling technologies, we at EnVitrum™ have developed a technique that will modernize our conceptions of glass, while offering a commercially viable green alternative to the landfill.</p>
